# About
A curated collection of small, dynamic projects demonstrating the seamless integration of React Redux stores and React Context. The repository offers a journey through the evolution of Redux, starting with traditional createStore to modern day configureStore as well as the use of React Context API, demonstrating the flow of data between React components.

The projects are also crafted with examples of frontend unit testing with React Testing Library. User interactions are enhanced with engaging sound effects, adding a layer of interactivity and fun to the learning experience.
